# sentiment_analysis_of_audio
This code uses Google's Speech Recognition to convert audio to text and later uses TextBlob to analyse the sentiment polarity of the said statements. This could easily be modified to read mutiple audio files. If you want to do this locally, have a look at CMU Sphinx/pocket sphinx.
